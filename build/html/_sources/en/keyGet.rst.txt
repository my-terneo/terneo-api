**Getting TOTP key**
====================

To securely control device with TOTP protocol authentication, you need to know the key, 
which is a sequence of 16 bytes. It's generated by the cloud at the first connection
and every time you bind to the account.
 
You can get it through the server API only in 2 steps:
	* get the authorization token for the required account
	* get a list of devices with parameters linked to this account

			"password":"myPassword"
		}

**Parameters:**
	- **email** - email of account
	- **password** - account password

**Answer:**

			"user_name":"myterneo",
			"is_timezone_chosen":true
		}

``access_token`` - required authorization token

**Example:**

  ..  code-block:: html

		{
			POST /api/login/ HTTP/1.1
			Host: my.hmarex.com
			Accept-Language: en
			Content-Type: application/json

		}


`Getting list of device`
````````````````````````
    
    **GET** https://my.hmarex.com/api/device/ --header "Authorization: Token ``access_token``

		**Parameters**
			- ``access_token`` - authorization token in header
        		
* Answer:

	.. code-block:: json

		{
			"count": 4,
			"next": null,
			"previous": null,
			"results": [
				{
					"id": 18801,
					"sn": "1100150010434B58363539XXXXXXXX",
					"name": "Room1",
					"":""
					"totp_key": "BW4ERXAJXXXXXXXX"
