Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document describes the protocol for the interaction of third-party applications with **DS Electronics** devices.

For Wi-Fi devices with a firmware version higher than 2.3, direct control via a local network is available. Information is exchanged through POST requests at http://``dev_ip``/api.cgi, where ``dev_ip`` is the ip address of the device on the local network. To detect new devices on the local network `broadcast <broadcast.html>`_ packets is used. Data is presented in JSON format.

.. important::
	The ability to control device via local network without authentification by default `blocked <safety.html>`_ for security reasons.

In firmware version 2.3 and higher the following JSON keys are available:

``sn`` - the serial number of the device, required when transferring new data into device.

``cmd`` - `send command <comands.html>`_ to receive data from the device (`parameters <parameters.html>`_, `schedule <schedule.html>`_, `telemetry <telemetry.html>`_)

``par`` - `change device parameters <parameters.html>`_

``tt`` - `transfer new schedule <schedule.html>`_

In firmware version 2.4 added:

``time``, ``auth`` - `authentication  <safety.html>`_

.. important::
	It is impossible to transfer the schedule and parameters in one request, as well as several days of the schedule.

.. note::
	The device has a page http://``dev_ip``/api.html, where you can check requests and test the exchange protocol.
